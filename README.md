## What is this?

Streamable Uploader is a small application to allow for easy upload to Streamable.com.

**If you have encountered any bugs or issues with this application, feel free to create an issue with your problem.**

**If you want to get it fixed faster or it's something urgent, you can join [my Discord](https://discord.gg/xaq23p7Jzf) and hit me (`Mira#2000`) with a ping.**

## Why use this?

This application has the option to be added to the context menu of videos, making uploading clips to Streamable.com even easier than it already is. Upon completion of the upload, it'll copy the link of the uploaded video to your clipboard for easy and fast sharing.

## Requirements

- A [Streamable Account](https://streamable.com) with a set password.
    - Upon first launch, you need to set your credentials with the `Update Login Information..` button.
        - Credentials are stored encrypted via your Windows User Account. It is possible to decrypt it when a 3rd party gains access to your Windows User Account.
        - Storing credentials this way should be somewhat secure while keeping the convenience of plain-text.

## Contributing or forking

Before building, you'll need [Xorog.UniversalExtensions](https://github.com/Fortunevale/Xorog.UniversalExtensions).

From there on, it should be as easy as cloning the repository and running `dotnet restore`.
